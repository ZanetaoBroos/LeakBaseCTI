# LeakBaseCTI
specialized investigative framework to investigate cases of malicious actors in the OSINT and backup LeakBase

This is a backup of the "illegal data sale and leak" room carried out by various actors from different countries. You can search by "actor name" or "post title" to get a list of the records we have.

Post search, username, and email search by validation, some OSINT methods, and an investigation guide.

It also allows exporting and is functional today (08-08-2025). Important sections such as stealer logs, big leaks, and other sections with the most posts, in addition to all users, are updated in the CSV.
